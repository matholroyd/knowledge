# Project types

## Personal projects

- The way it often goes for me
  1. When building my own pet project, I tend to focus on what I want the product to look like at the end.
  1. When I do that, I put off niggles along the way. In short, I end up doing big design upfront.
  1. If I do that I end up with a product that can only achieve a narrow set of goals, and is hard to achieve others as it has been poorly engineered along the way.
  1. It is hard for other people to help me, as they don't understand by vision.
- Insight 
  1. Building only the simplest core feature and growing from there prevents me from.
