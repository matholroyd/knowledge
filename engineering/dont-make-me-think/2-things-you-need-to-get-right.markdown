# Things you need to get right

## Street signs and breadcrumbs

- People won't use your site if they can't find what they're looking for.
- Its hard for users to know when to stop looking.

### Browsing a site vs a department store

Using a site is analogous to going to a department store in many way.
- You're typically there to find something.
- You can either read the sign posts, or use the search.

But a site is also different in some key ways.
- No sense of scale (are there 10 more pages of search results, or 1000?)
- No sense of direction or location. You may have found the page you were looking for after many steps, but you can't save time the 2nd time since shortcuts may not be apparent.

Home pages are important for this reason- they give a much needed sense of location. Also persistent navigation is invaluable to users.

### Word choice

- Don't pick unusual words that have wide spread adoption. Examples include "Search", "Home".

### Multi-level navigation

- Good multi-level navigation is hard. That said, it should be give just as much attention as top-level, the reason being users can often spend just as much time on lower-level pages as top-level.
- Current page should be clearly highlighted via the upper-levels on the navigation.
- Don't use breadcrumbs as a substitution for good overall navigation. They should have a useful.

### Page names

- Every page should have a name.
- Should be clear what is the page name.
- Page name should frame the title.
- Page names should match what the user clicked. OK to violate this when the different name matches within the context, e.g. "Gifts for him" => "Gifts for men"

### Litmus test for good design

Imagine for any page on your site, if you arrived at that page blindly, would you be to:
- Know what site it is?
- Know what page you are on?
- Know what the major sections of the site are?
- Know what my options are?
- How can I search?

## The big bang theory of web design

The home page needs to accomplish many important things, hence the difficulty in designing the home page. The home page with have many of the following elements:
- Identify the site and mission.
- Show the site hierarchy.
- Have search.
- Teases to entice people, e.g. screenshots.
- Content promotions, e.g. new content.
- Feature promotions.
- Timely content.
- Deals.
- Shortcuts.
- Registration.

Abstract objectives the home page probably has.
- Show me what I am looking for.
- ...and what I am not looking for.
- She me where to start.
- Establish credibility and trust.

Challenges for designing the home page:
- Everybody wants a piece of it.
- Too many cooks. Everyone has an opinion about it.
- One size fits all. HAs to appeal to everyone who visits it.

### How to get the message across

- Tagline.
- The welcome blurb.
- "Learn more" link
- Use as much space as necessary
- ...but don't use more than necessary.
- Don't use happy talk mission statements as the welcome blurb. No one reads them.

### Nothing beats a good tagline

- 6 to 8 words. Just long enough, but not too long.
- Good taglines convey differentiation. I.e. a really good tagline is one only your site could use.
- Bad taglines sound generic.
- Taglines convey a value proposition. This is different to a nice sounding motto.

### Why golden geese make such tempting targets

- Maintaining the home page requires constant vigilance.
