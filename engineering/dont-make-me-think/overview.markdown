# Don't make me think - Book overview

## Guiding principles

Notes:
- Clarity trumps consistency
  - But don't take this too far. Sacrifice a bit of consistency if things are made much clearer.
- The more important something is, the more prominent it should be
- Things related logically are related visually
- Things are "nested" visually to show what's part of what
- Make sure different levels of heading have clear distinctions 

Comments:
- A good visual hierarchy saves the reader work by preprocessing the pages for us, organizing and prioritizing its contents in a way that we can grasp almost instantly.

Clicks:
- Clicking lots of times is ok, so long as each click is a mindless, unambiguous choice.
- What matters more is not how many clicks I have to make, but how hard each click is.

## Krugs laws

### Third law

*Get rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of half of what's left.*

## Things you need to get right

Notes:
- People won't use your site if they can't find what they're looking for.
- Its hard for users to know when to stop looking.

### Navigation

Notes:
- Navigation reveals content. 
- By making navigation hierachy visible, navigation tells us what content there is.
- If done well, navigation tells you implicitly where to begin and what your options are. 
- If done well, navigation is all the instructions you need.
