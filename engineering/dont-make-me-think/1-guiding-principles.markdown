# Guiding principles

## Don't make me think!

### First law

** Don't make me think! **

- Note this is different to common answers like, "Nothing important should be more than 2 clicks away."
- This means things like
  - Give links obvious, common names
  - Make clickable things obviously clickable
  - Make forms easy to fill out, e.g. figure out "New York" if type in "ny" for city.
- Main motivation for this is the competition is only 1 click away.

## How we really use the web

** We scan, we don't read **

- Users normally on a mission
- Users know they don't need to ready everything
- Users are good at scanning

## Billboard design 101

- Take advantage of conventions
- Create effective visual hierarchies
- Break pages up into clearly defined areas
- Make it obvious what is clickable
- Eliminate distractions
- Format content to facilitate scanning

### Navigation and design

- Clarity trumps consistency
  - But don't take this too far. Sacrifice a bit of consistency if things are made much clearer.
- The more important something is, the more prominent it should be
- Things related logically are related visually
- Things are "nested" visually to show what's part of what
- Make sure different levels of heading have clear distinctions
- A good visual hierarchy saves the reader work by preprocessing the pages for us, organizing and prioritizing its contents in a way that we can grasp almost instantly.

Navigation
- Navigation reveals content.
- By making navigation hierachy visible, navigation tells us what content there is.
- If done well, navigation tells you implicitly where to begin and what your options are.
- If done well, navigation is all the instructions you need.

## Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral?

### Second law

**It doesn't matter how many times I have to click, as long as each click is a mindless, unambiguous choice**

- What matters more is not how many clicks I have to make, but how hard each click is.

## Omit words

### Third law

** Get rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of half of what's left.

### Happy talk

- Get rid of happy talk. People don't care. They want to get shit done, solve their problems. Don't waste people's time.
- Aim to get rid of all instructions. Completing objectives should be self explanatory. If instructions are necessary, cut them down to their necessary components.
