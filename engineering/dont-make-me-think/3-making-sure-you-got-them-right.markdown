# Making sure you got them right

## The farmer and the cowman should be friends

- Be careful of design discussions. They often end up like religious/political discussions, where everything is emotion and no one changes their opinion.
- People make arguments like "Everyone likes ..."
- Antidote to religious discussions about design is asking very specific questions: E.g. "Does this pull down, with these items and this wording in this context on this page create a good experience for most people who are likely to use this site?"

## Usability testing on 10 cents a day

### Focus groups are not usability tests

- Focus groups are about a small number of people's opinions. They are useful for getting a sampling of people's feelings about something.
- Usability tests are about watching an individual do a typical task, maybe on a prototype or a real website. They are useful for finding things that confuse or frustrate users.
- Focus groups are good in the planning phase, as they tell you what you should build. Usability tests is something you should do all the time.

### Several true things about usability testing

- If you want a great site, you have to test.
- Testing 1 user is 100% better than testing none.
- Testing 1 user earler is betten than testing 50 near the end.

### How often should you test?

- Recommend 1 morning once a month. 
  - Test in the morning, debrief over lunch.
  - Keep it simple so you keep doing it.
  - It give you what you need.
  - It frees you from deciding what to test.
  - It makes it likely people will attend.

### Hoe many user do you need?

- The purpose isn't to prove anything.
- You don't need to find all of the problems.

### How to choose the participants?

- Reruit loosely and grade on a curve. Try to find people who reflect your audience, but don't get hung up about it.
  - Not a good idea to design a site that only your target audience can use.
  - We're all beginners under the skin.
