# Windows 10 Linux (Ubuntu) subsystem setup

[https://gorails.com/setup/windows/10](https://gorails.com/setup/windows/10) has pretty good instructions. 
Main thing I deviated on is to get Postgres running, instead of running from within the linux subsystem, 
I simply installed a working version via `chocolatey`.
