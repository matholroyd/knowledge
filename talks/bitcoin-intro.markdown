# Bitcoin intro

## What is bitcoin?

- Bitcoin is new type of money 
  - 100% digital
    - Just need to download software to use
    - Cryptography forms backbone of bitcoin

### What is money?

- Lots of things have been used as money
  - Seashells, tobacco, stones, cows, salt
  - Desirable properties of money
    - Easily identifiable/hard to forge
    - Easily divisible
    - Easy to carry in your pocket
    - Doesn't degrade      
    - Non-reversible
    - Has value in its own right
      - E.g. you can eat a cow, smoke tobacco
    - Scarce
      - Expensive/impossible to produce more
    - New desirable properties that were never considered before
      - Anonymity
- Fiat currency is what all governments use through out the world
  - Fiat means 'by decree' or 'by law'
  - Contrast fiat to money created by a free market
    - Has no intrinsic value (debatable- see below)
    - Is not scarce (trivial for governments to produce more, both cash and electronic balances)
    - Electronic payments are _always_ reversible
    - Electronic payments are normally not anonymous
- Ongoing argument in bitcoin world whether bitcoin is not a good money because it doesn't have value in its own right
  - Personal opinion is intrinsic value is not necessary
    - Fiat currencies prove money does not need intrinsic value per se
    - Criticism of fiat is mainly based on it being easily inflated rather then its lack of intrinsic value
    - Arguably the 'usefulness' or 'utility' of fiat + bitcoin give them intrinsic value

### 'Normal' money vs bitcoin

- Bitcoin same as most money you can think of
  - You only do one of 3 things with bitcoin
    - Send bitcoin to someone
    - Receive bitcoin from someone
    - Do nothing (e.g. save)

### History of bitcoin

- Started by someone called Satoshi in ~2007.
- First client release start of 2009
- First blockchain mined in 2009
- Open source with open source algorithms/cryptography, so no one has to trust Satoshi

### Differences of bitcoin to other money

- Decentralized
  - No central issuing authority
    - No arbitrary/centralized inflation
  - No group can freeze another groups bitcoin account
  - No one can prevent anyone else from using bitcoin
    - I.e. all you need is the software
  - Difficult to shutdown
- Tiny or zero fees
  - Fees are typically 0
  - If there is a fee, usually way less then < 0.1%
  - Compare this to credit cards/paypal that charge 1.5 ~ 4%
- Payments non-reversible
  - Contrast this to PayPal
  - Also normal bank payments + credit card payments, etc can theoretically be reversed in cases of fraud
- Transaction history is public
  - Every transaction is public record
  - Anonymity is achieved when owners of bitcoins remain anonymous
  - People call bitcoin pseudo anonymous
- New bitcoins made by 'mining' 
  - 50 bitcoins produced every ~10 minutes
  - First miner to solve a difficult maths problem gets rewards
  - Mining is the way transactions are verified
    - Prevent double spending
  - Acts as incentive for early adopters, to run mining rigs
  - Additionally miners receive 'transaction' fees
    - Miners can refuse to process any transaction they choose, e.g. market based
    - Assumed that in the future, when the mining reward becomes very small, transaction fees will act as the incentive
- Deflationary by design
  - Based on precious metals (e.g. gold/silver)
  - Gold/silver + bitcoin do what money is supposed to do: store wealth
    - Bitcoins will go up in value compared to e.g. fiat currency
    - Bitcoin divisible up to 8 decimal places. Protocol can easily be changed to adopt more decimal places, ad nauseam.
  - Controlled supply of money increase
  - Every ~10 minutes, 50 bitcoins added to the total pool of bitcoins
  - Rate of new bitcoins introduced decreases over time asymtotically
    - Every 4 years, rate halves, so 50 bitcoins will become 25, 25 => 12.5, and so on
  - Maximum is 21 million (~10 million have been issue already)
  - First rate reduction will occur roughly december this year!
    - Theoretically value will have increased dramatically by that time
    - Will likely increase before that in anticipation
    
## Why should you care?

- Governments will use virtual currency in the future
  - Governments continuously encroach on areas as monitoring becomes ever cheaper
    - Communication (face-to-face conversation + postal mail + telephone + email)
    - Travel (passports didn't exist 100 years ago)                   
    - Individual identification (finger printing requirements, biometric scanning)
    - Surveillance (video cameras + microphones in public places)
    - Association (jobs criteria if e.g. working with children)
    - Ownership (driving/boat/gun/property licenses)
    - Finances (tax returns + bank account tracking)
  - Governments interested in tracking anything they can about money
    - One of the main responsibilities of the Australian Federal Police is to protect the government's revenue
    - Aside from that, AFP has power to pry into financial records to track other forms of criminal activity                                                           
    - AFP can freeze accounts as well
    - Put those together, government can justify any money tracking/freezing they want
    - Virtual currencies are trivial/cheap to track for e.g. tax avoidance
  - Hence, governments will inevitably require citizens to switch to virtual currency
    - Trivial to copy and modify bitcoin so have centralized control + monitoring
    - We already use virtual currency in a sense. Just have to get rid of cash.
    - Already have examples moving in this way
      - MintChip in Canada
      - Sweden doesn't accept cash for public transport
      - Italy illegal to do transactions in cash if €1000+ 
      - All countries restrict national currency movement electronically
        - There is a pervasive myth that only a few countries like China do this
  - Thus virtual currencies will become increasingly more important in the future
    - Currency make up ~1/2 of every transaction
    - A shift to virtual currency means skills/knowledge will increase in demand
    - Businesses will need to understand and use virtual currencies
    - Bitcoin is the best virtual currency to invest time in
      - First to be decentralized
      - Has a track record
      - Active community
      - Bitcoin is still largely ignored by governments   
      - Individuals and businesses (i.e. non-government entities) are very interested in privacy, and thus the bitcoin project naturally trends towards improving user privacy (though its far from perfect)
- Protect your assets
  - All fiat currencies lose value over time
    - This is intentional
    - Need understanding of economics in the field of monetary policy
  - Shares/equities are not an alternative for average joe
    - You are competing against professionals with large resources
  - Still have to pay capital gains, unless held in country that doesn't care (e.g. Hong Kong)
- Open yourself to an emerging global market
  - 10s of millions of dollars transacted daily
  - Any merchant/customer can use bitcoin. No forms, no government approval required.
  - Avoid fraud as a merchant
  - Bitcoin fantastic for customers/merchants in corrupt/heavily regulated countries
    - Belarus -> 40% tax for online payments, server must be hosted in Belarus
    - US -> must report any asset + income held in any country to government. Many non-US banks now don't accept US customers because of this law 
    - Italy -> forbids any purchase of €1000 or greater with cash (must be electronic)
    - Every country -> very difficult for foreigners to setup local bank account
  
    
## Safety

- Assume that if you lose your bitcoins, no government agency will help you
- 3rd parties
  - Be very careful
    - Bitcoinica
    - Exchanges
  - If sounds too good to be true, it often is
    - Bitcoin Savings and Trust
  - Look for strong reputation, or connection to real world arbitration
  - Technically possible for vendor to offer some services where don't have to trust them
- Personal wallet
  - Avoid most online wallet services 
    - Examples
      - MyWallet.com (closed now)
      - Coinbase.com
      - Easywallet.org
    - Small amount maybe ok
    - Online ok if wallet encrypted before it gets to them
      - Blockchain.info
  - Mobile wallets are your friend
    - Bitcoin spinner
    - Blockchain.info (mac app cannot do payments)
  - If use desktop client
    - Make sure its encrypted
    - Better yet, encrypt whole HDD + backups
  - Backup your passwords/wallets!
    - Responsibility is for you to keep your passwords + wallet safe
    - Print out to paper  
- Anonymity
  - Use a different bitcoin address for every transaction
  - Don't publish your bitcoin addresses
  - Don't assume you can't be tracked if e.g. some government really wants to find out who you are
