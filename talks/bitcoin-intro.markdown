                                                                                       # Bitcoin intro

## What is bitcoin?

- New type of money
  - Lots of things have been used as money
    - Seashells, tobacco, stones, cows, salt
    - Desirable values of money
      - Easily identifiable/hard to forge
      - Easily divisible
      - Easy to carry in your pocket
      - Doesn't degrade
      - Has value in its own right
        - E.g. you can eat cows, smoke tobacco
        - maybe?
  - Fiat currency is what all governments use through out the world
    - Fiat means 'by decree' or 'by law'
    - Contrast this to tobacco, cows, salt
  - Ongoing argument in bitcoin world whether bitcoin is not a good money because it doesn't have value in its own right
    - Personal opinion is it doesn't matter
      - Fiat currencies prove a money does not need value in an of itself
      - Aversion to fiat is based on it is easily inflated rather then its lack of intrinsic value
      - Arguably the 'usefulness' or 'utility' of fiat + bitcoins give them intrinsic value

### History of bitcoin

- Started by someone called Satoshi in ~2007.
- First client release start of 2009
- First blockchain minded in 2009
- Open source with open source algorithms/cryptography, so no one has to trust Satoshi


### Differences of bitcoin to other money

- Decentralized
  - No central issuing authority
  - No group can freeze another groups bitcoin account
  - No one can prevent anyone else from using bitcoin
    - I.e. all you need is the software
  - Difficult to shutdown
- Tiny or zero fees
  - Fees are typically 0
  - If there is a fee, usually way less then < 0.1%
  - Compare this to credit cards/paypal that charge 1.5 ~ 4%
- Payments non-reversible
  - Contrast this to PayPal
  - Also normal bank payments + credit card payments, etc can theoretically be reversed in cases of fraud
- Transaction history is public
  - Every transaction is public record
  - Anonymity is achieved when owners of bitcoins remain anonymous
  - People call bitcoin pseudo anonymous
- New bitcoins made by 'mining' 
  - 50 bitcoins produced every ~10 minutes
  - First miner to solve a difficult maths problem gets rewards
  - Mining is the way transactions are verified
    - Prevent double spending
  - Acts as incentive for early adopters, to run mining rigs
  - Additionally miners receive 'transaction' fees
    - Miners can refuse to process any transaction they choose
    - Assumed that in the future, when the mining reward becomes very small, transaction fees will act as the incentive
- Deflationary by design
  - Based on precious metals (e.g. gold/silver)
  - Gold/silver + bitcoin do what money is supposed to do: store wealth
    - Bitcoins will go up in value compared to e.g. fiat currency
  - Controlled supply of money increase
  - Every ~10 minutes, 50 bitcoins added to the total pool of bitcoins
  - Rate of new bitcoins introduced decreases over time asymtotically
    - Every 4 years, rate halves, so 50 bitcoins will become 25, 25 => 12.5, and so on
  - Maximum is 21 million (~10 million have been issue already)
  - First rate reduction will occur roughly december this year!
    - Theoretically value will have increased dramatically by that time
    - Will likely increase before that in anticipation
    
### Why should you care?

- Governments will use virtual currency in the future
  - Governments continuously encroach on areas where monitoring becomes cheap enough
    - Communication (compare mail to telephone, and telephone to email)
    - Travel (passports didn't exist 100 years ago)
    - Finances (tax returns, bank account tracking very recent)
  - Governments interested in tracking anything they can about money
    - One of the main laws pertaining to the Australian Federal Police is to protect the governments revenue
    - Aside from that, obviously AFP is supposed to track other forms of criminal activity
    - Put that together, government can justify any money tracking they want
  - Hence, logically, governments will require citizens to use virtual currency
    - We already use virtual currency in a sense. Just have to get rid of cash.
    - Cheaper to track virtual currency
    - Trivial to copy and modify bitcoin so have centralized control + monitoring
    - MintChip in Canada
    - Sweden doesn't accept cash for public transport
  - Bitcoin is thus the best attempt to push back on these trends
    - Bitcoin still maintains utility in an online world, unlike gold or silver
- Protect your assets
  - All fiat currencies lose value over time                 
    - This is intentional
    - Need understanding of economics in the field of monetary policy
  - Shares/equities are not an alternative for average joe
    - You are competing against professionals with large resources
  - Still have to pay capital gains, unless held in country that doesn't care (e.g. Hong Kong)
- Open yourself to a global market place
  - Any merchant/customer can use bitcoin. No forms, no government approval required.
  - Avoid fraud as a merchant
  - Bitcoin fantastic for customers/merchants in corrupt/heavily regulated countries
    - Belarus, 40% tax for online payments
    - US, must report any asset + income held in any country to government. Many non-US banks now don't accept US customers because of this law 
    - Italy, forbids any purchase of â‚¬3000 or greater with cash (must be electronic)
    - Every country, very difficult for foreigners to setup local bank account

      - Blockchain.info
  - Mobile wallets are your friend
    - Bitcoin spinner
    - Blockchain.info (mac app cannot do payments)
