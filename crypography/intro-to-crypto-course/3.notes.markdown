# Blockciphers

## What is block cipher

- Has encryption + decryption algorithms, E and D
- plaintext size = ciphertext size
- Splits input into blocks (of size n bits)
- Blocks encrypted over several 'rounds'
- 3DES
  - n = 64 bits
  - k = 168 bits
  - 48 rounds
- AES
  - n = 128 bits
  - k = 128, 192, 256 bits
  - 10 rounds

## Pseudo Random Permutation (PRP) 
- User interchangeably to describe blockcipher
- Formally abstraction of a block cipher
- Basically something is PRP if:
  1. Exists efficient algorithm that deterministically maps X -> X (where X is set of values)
  1. The function E(k, x) is one-to-one
  1. Exists efficient inversion algorithm D(k, y)
- PRP is basically a Pseudo Random Function (PRF) but with more constraints
