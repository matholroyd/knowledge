# Linux basics

## Distributions

Linux distributions is an operating system based on the linux kernel. Each distribution usually consists of key pieces of software, such as packaging system, a window system, compile and other system tools.

The systems used in a distribution may have been tailored to fit the needs of that distribution, but otherwise the systems are not necessarily heavily edited to work with particular distribution.


## Package manager

A tool or set of tools used to maintain (e.g. download, install, upgrade, downgrade, delete) software packages.  The software packages maintained might include the linux kernel itself, as well as numereous system services such as C libraries, as well as arbitrary software packages like music players. A packaging system is often included in linux distributions.

The packages may be pre-compiled binaries or source code that is compiled inbetween downloading and installing.

## systemd

`systemd` is a linux `init` service used by linux distributions. It has replaced `init` (and other daemons) on many linux distributions.

`systemd` is both the name of the daemon and also the collection of services, of which the `systemd` daemon is part of.
