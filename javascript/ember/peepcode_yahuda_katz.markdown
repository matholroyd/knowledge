# Peepcode - Yahuda Katz play-by-play

I learnt making a screen cast of a professional coder stumbling around debugging stuff for 20mins is a terrible way to learn programming (or emberjs for that matter).

Please try harder Mr Peepecode. If I wanted to watch someone stumbling around in code, I'd record myself.
