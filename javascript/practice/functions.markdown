# Functions

    var f = function () {
       // do something
    }
    
    var f = function 

- Same as object, but 
  - Obvious links to some source code
  - Has a reference to its context, e.g. `this`

## Function.prototype

- Each function by default has prototype pointing to Function.prototype

## Patterns of invocation styles

1. method
1. function
1. constructor
1. apply
